# 🙏🏻 Namaskar, I'm Naman Dubey
**AI Developer | Solution Builder | Problem Solver**

I am a software engineer who builds systems to solve complex, real-world problems. I don't just write code; **I architect solutions**. My work spans **Generative AI**, **Agentic Systems**, and **Marketing Technology**, bridging the gap between deep-tech research and scalable production engineering.

My core interest lies in the **Marketing & Content Generation** domain—building Adobe-like creative tools, performance marketing engines, and automated content pipelines.

## 🧠 Core Competencies
* **Agentic AI:** Architecting Multi-Agent Systems (LangGraph) that plan, execute, and reason.
* **Generative Media:** Building deterministic pipelines for Image (Stable Diffusion) and Audio (CLAP/LDM) generation.
* **Systems Engineering:** Deploying models via FastAPI, Docker, and Kubernetes for low-latency inference.
* **Operations Research:** Solving optimization problems using MILP and Reinforcement Learning.

## 🚀 Current Research & Development (The "Big 3")
*These projects are currently in active research and development phases.*

### **Janta (Research Phase)**
**AI-Driven Civic Engagement & Marketing Platform**
* **The Vision:** A MarTech platform designed for high-scale social and political campaigns.
* **The Problem:** Grassroots campaigns lack the enterprise-grade tools needed for hyper-local targeting and content scale.
* **The Tech:** Exploring AI Agents for automated content generation, Sentiment Analysis for social listening, and Next.js for scalable delivery.
* **Focus:** Performance marketing at a civic scale.

### **[Foley Bridge](https://github.com/yaaayaaavar/foleybridge) (Under Development)**
**Context-Aware AI Sound Design Agent**
* **The Innovation:** Automated "Acoustic Rendering" for silent video clips—automating the "boring" parts of post-production.
* **The Tech:** Researching Vision-Language Models (LLaVA) to understand scene context and Depth Estimation to simulate room acoustics (reverb/echo).
* **Impact:** Bridges the gap between visual editing and professional sound design.

### **[Purpose for Wellbeing](https://github.com/yaaayaaavar/purpose-for-wellbeing) (Under Development)**
**Privacy-First AI Assistant for Digital Health**
* **The Problem:** Digital burnout and fatigue are invisible.
* **The Solution:** A local-first application that uses Computer Vision (Eye-Tracking/Head Pose) to detect fatigue in real-time without sending data to the cloud.
* **Tech Stack:** Python (FastAPI), React 19, TypeScript, OpenCV, WebSockets.
* **Key Feature:** Zero-latency, on-device behavioral analysis.
