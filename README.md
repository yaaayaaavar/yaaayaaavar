# Namaskar, I'm Naman Dubey ✌️
**AI Developer | Solution Builder | Problem Solver**

I am a software engineer who builds systems to solve complex, real-world problems. I don't just write code; **I architect solutions**. My work spans **Generative AI**, **Agentic Systems**, and **Marketing Technology**, bridging the gap between deep-tech research and scalable production engineering.
My core interest lies in bringing AI Automation in the **Marketing & Content Generation** domain—building Adobe-like creative tools, performance marketing engines, and automated content pipelines.

## ⚛️ Core Competencies
* **Agentic AI & Reasoning Engines:** Architecting autonomous Multi-Agent Systems (LangGraph) that go beyond simple chatbots. I build agents that can plan, reason, and execute complex workflows—specifically for MarTech and Content Orchestration domains.
* **Generative Media & Creative Automation:** Engineering deterministic, production-grade pipelines for Image, Audio, and Video generation. My focus is on building the infrastructure for next-gen, Adobe-style creative tools that solve the "Blank Canvas" problem for creators.
* **Full-Stack AI Engineering:** Bridging the gap between research and production. I don't just ship models; I build scalable FastAPI microservices, manage async task queues (Redis/Celery), and ensure robust upstream/downstream integration using Docker and Kubernetes.
* **Algorithmic Optimization:** Applying mathematical rigor to system chaos. I solve complex resource allocation and efficiency problems using Reinforcement Learning, proving that code is only as good as the logic behind it.

## 📂 Current Research & Development (The "Big 3")
*These projects are currently in active research and development phases.*

### 📝 **[Janta for India](https://github.com/yaaayaaavar/project-janta-core) (Research Phase)** 💡
**AI-Driven Civic Engagement & Marketing Platform**
* **The Vision:** A MarTech platform designed to democratize high-scale political and social campaigning for grassroots leaders in India.
* **The Problem:** Current ad platforms (Meta/Google) rely on broad targeting (Zip Codes/Interests) that fails in the Indian political context, which operates on hyper-local "Booth" and "Ward" dynamics. Small-time leaders lack the tools to reach their specific constituents effectively.
* **The Tech:** Architecting a Multi-Agent System (Ingestion Agent -> Mapping Agent -> Strategy Agent) to autonomously scan local sentiment and generate actionable campaign strategies.
* **Focus:** Solving the "Right Reach" problem for civic campaigns using High-Dimensional Cohort Intelligence.

### 🎬 **[Foley Bridge](https://github.com/yaaayaaavar/foleybridge) (Under Development)** 🚧
**Context-Aware AI Sound Design Agent**
* **The Innovation:** Automated "Acoustic Rendering" for silent video clips—automating the "boring" parts of post-production.
* **The Tech:** Researching Vision-Language Models (LLaVA) to understand scene context and Depth Estimation to simulate room acoustics (reverb/echo).
* **Impact:** Bridges the gap between visual editing and professional sound design.

### 🧠 **[Purpose for Wellbeing](https://github.com/yaaayaaavar/purpose-for-wellbeing) (Under Development)** 🚧
**Privacy-First AI Assistant for Digital Health**
* **The Problem:** Digital burnout and fatigue are invisible.
* **The Solution:** A local-first application that uses Computer Vision (Eye-Tracking/Head Pose) to detect fatigue in real-time without sending data to the cloud.
* **Tech Stack:** Python (FastAPI), React 19, TypeScript, OpenCV, WebSockets.
* **Key Feature:** Zero-latency, on-device behavioral analysis.
